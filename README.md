# Manga-Generator
Use it to generate manga from images.
Create a folder where all the images you are going to save. 
As for the the images you can use weeb central's extension available in chrome web store to download manga images chapterwise from weeb central's website itself.
Change the images_folder's location to your folder's location and the output_dir to your desired location where the manga will be saved in epub format.
Enjoy!
